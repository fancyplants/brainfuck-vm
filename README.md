# brainfuck-vm


## Currently:
* Accepts one argument, a valid Brainfuck program, and runs it


## Todo
* Make a REPL?
  * But how do I handle typing a statement vs brainfuck itself accepting input
  * Perhaps I would break "out" of brainfuck and "into" the repl whenever all code has been executed in a statement?
